"""
Behaviors/Hover
===============

.. rubric:: Changing when the mouse is on the widget and the widget is visible.

To apply hover behavior, you must create a new class that is inherited from the
widget to which you apply the behavior and from the :attr:`HoverBehavior` class.

In `KV file`:

.. code-block:: kv

    <HoverItem@MDBoxLayout+HoverBehavior>

In `python file`:

.. code-block:: python

    class HoverItem(MDBoxLayout, HoverBehavior):
        '''Custom item implementing hover behavior.'''

After creating a class, you must define two methods for it:
:attr:`HoverBehavior.on_enter` and :attr:`HoverBehavior.on_leave`, which will be automatically called
when the mouse cursor is over the widget and when the mouse cursor goes beyond
the widget.

.. note::

    :class:`~HoverBehavior` will by default check to see if the current Widget is visible (i.e. not covered by a modal or popup and not a part of a Relative Layout, MDTab or Carousel that is not currently visible etc) and will only issue events if the widget is visible.

    To get the legacy behavior that the events are always triggered, you can set `detect_visible` on the Widget to `False`.
