# TODO: Issue #70: Vorbis files with multiple logical bitstreams could
# be supported by chaining VorbisFile instances (with say a 'next'
# attribute that points to the next VorbisFile that would contain the
# PCM for the next logical bitstream).  A considerable constraint to
# implementing this was that examples files that demonstrated multiple
# logical bitstreams couldn't be found or created.  Note that even
# Audacity doesn't handle multiple logical bitstreams (see
# https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/OGG#Importing_multiple_stream_files).

# TODO: Issue #53: Unicode file names are not well supported.
# They may work in macOS and Linux, they don't work under Windows.
